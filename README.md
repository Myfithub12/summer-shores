# summer-shores
This exercise simulates a person completing a list of Saturday summer chores — with a chance of falling asleep along the way. The project demonstrates how callback functions work and how “callback hell” can form when tasks depend on one another.

 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 The program runs through a fixed sequence of chores:
- Mow the yard
- Weed eat the edges
- Trim the hedges
- Collect fallen wood
- Water the garden
Each chore takes a different amount of time and may cause the person to get tired. If they fall asleep, the chain stops early. If they stay awake through all tasks, they finish all their chores successfully

TECHNOLOGIES USED
- JavaScript
- Node.js

2. open your terminal and navigate to the project folder 'summer-chores' whereever you have it stored.
3. Run the javascript file: node callbackVersion.js
